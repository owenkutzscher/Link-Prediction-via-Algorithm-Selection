# Link Prediction via Algorithm Selection

Training a ML model to pick the best edge prediction algorithm to use on different sets of biological networks.

For a summary of this project see the pdf document: 'Final Project Paper CSCI 3352 - Owen Kutzscher'

To run this code, go to _04_using_3_data_sets and click through the cells. If you are interested in how any of the sub-functions work, go to any of the _01, _02, _03 files to see them in more detail.
